# telugu-radio

A little Alexa skill I whipped up for my mom, who wanted to more easily listen to Telugu radio stations. 
This serves links to publicly available Telugu radio streams from a voice interface. 

Example commands:
- "Ask telugu radio to list all stations"
- "Ask telugu radio to play radio number four"
- "Ask telugu radio to play a random station"

Unfortunately, Amazon did not permit release of this skill as they do not support skills serving Telugu content.
However it is still possible to use this skill by [releasing it as a beta test](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/skills-beta-testing-for-alexa-skills.html) (and it's how the skill is deployed today!)
